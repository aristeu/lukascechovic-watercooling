# *Starting point*

1. aluminium cooling blocks from Mellow with M5 and M6 (driver block) threads and 4mm OD tubing
2. to preventing galvanic corrosion we should use all items with same metal as mellow blocks = aluminium

## Fittings material

We can easily brass and copper nickel plated fittings and stainless steel 304 fittings where is theory neither of those should be used together with aluminium in same cooling curcuit.

# *Starting point*
*PC watercooling practise*

1. You dont need high flow
2. One loop
3. Order of items in loop is not important
4. Radiator is main player in capacity of the loop to disipate heat

Explanation:

https://github.com/lukascechovic/watercooling/tree/main/research%20info%20gathered

1. You dont need high flow = lower flow = more time in radiator = lower temperature of coolant
2. One loop = "If you are cooling multiple components you don't need multiple loops. Just run it in series and you'll be fine and save some money and headaches."
3. Order of items in loop is not important = you can find lots of video on Youtube for example https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnPB_q51iVk&t=130s

*Note: My watercooling journey started on Vez3D youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/@Vez3D*

# *Starting point*

1. 4mm OD fitting on aluminium cooling blocks from Mellow with M5 and M6 (driver block) threads, push in with plastic parts

## Tubing Diameter
   As inner diameter of M5 fitting is around 1.78mm is questionable need for wider tubing as 6mm with 4mm ID.

## Tubing material

In the picture you can see theory for different tubing materials. I got PU, PVC and Silicone tubing. Concerns about Silicone is that it could easier slip from fitting but on the other hand I like it really much for printhead as silicone is far more softer than PU which is stiff in comparison. I like PU everywhere because it is hard to kink it, just on printhead I prefer Silicone or PVC. PVC is something between PU and Silicone, more on Silicone side, by softness. PU tends stick to fittning and it is somethimes hard to remove it.

## Tubing length

Around 7 meters for full watercooling Vz235, but I would go for 10 to be ready for some misstakes. 10m of PU and 2m Silicone or PVC

##Note: After removing tubing from fitting somethimes it is wise to cut used end of tubing before put it back.

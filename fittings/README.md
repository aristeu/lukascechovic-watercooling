# *Starting point*

1. aluminium cooling blocks from Mellow with M5 and M6 (driver block) threads and 4mm OD tubing
2. to preventing galvanic corrosion we should use all items with same metal as mellow blocks = aluminium

## Fittings material

*conclusion: my searching for full aluminium fittings failed. Closest I got were items from https://tameson.com/collections/aluminum-push-on-fittings . But upod delivery I reasised that item description is false and they contain steel parts. So based on Alphacool statement we should be fine with nickel plated brass fittings with premix coolant water*

We can easily buy brass and copper nickel plated fittings and stainless steel 304 fittings where is theory neither of those should be used together with aluminium in one cooling loop.

EKWB block on this topic with lot of details https://www.ekwb.com/blog/aluminium-vs-copper/

EKWB as main player in PC watercooling is strct about this, they are even prohibiting to use their pumps in aluminium containing loops.

On the other hand Alphacool as other player in this alows use all of their pumps in aluminium and copper loops and also using their brass nickel plated fittings in aluminium loops. (https://github.com/lukascechovic/watercooling/tree/main/research%20info%20gathered). But to be fair their statement "Our fittings are all anodized, painted or nickel-plated and they have no contact with the liquid, so you can use any of our fittings in your loop." sounds little weird to me.

Note to the stainless steel, in our conditions should be active if I understand it well.

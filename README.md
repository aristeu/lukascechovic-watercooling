# Watercooling for 3d printers based on Vz235 build and Mellow motor, drivers and extruder aluminium watercooling blocks. Warning page is in building process

Experiences from building up watercooled 3d printer or how to make rigth choices for your build. Information based on internet "research" and communication with PC watercooling community, Alphacool and EKWB company info lines.

**Long story short** 

- one big loop
- D5/VPP655/maybe Apex pump
- 2.4/4mm tubing (easy routing around printer)(polyurethane (10m) and optional silicone/pvc(2m) softer for printhead)
- 3x12cm aluminium radiator for easy top mounting
- brass nickel plated fittings (optional stainless steel 304)(idealy aluminium but I was not able to find any in this world) 
- clear coolant premix

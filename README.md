*Question 1:* Hello, I would like to buy pupm from you into custom aluminium loop (alu blocks and radiators). I got confused with note in your products "This product should NOT be installed with any aluminum Fluid Gaming parts!" . Does it means I cannot use it in Aluminium containing loop? Could you please explaint to me that note and are your pumps suitable to work in custom all aluminium loop? Thanks. Have a nice day.

***Answer 1:*** Hello, thank you for contacting us. The mentioned product is not compatible with ALU parts. We used to sell products that were compatible with ALU products. Unfortunately, we no longer sell ALU products. We still have some ALU water blocks or fittings available. Unfortunately, radiators and water pumps are no longer available.

*Question 1:* Hello, I'm looking for pump into full alluminium loop. Its for custom machine with low diametter tubing (4 or 6 mm) in total length up to 10m, with 7 small aluminium blocks. If I'm not wrong I should look for higher head meters value pump. I'm searching for answers for several days but no luck for now. Last info I got is that I cannot use even stainless steel parts pump with aluminium. VPP655 pumps are marked as ceramic and plastic (Kunststoff;Keramik;) but on video they've definitely got some other metal inside. What pumps I can use in aluminium containing loop? Thanks for answer. Have a nice day.

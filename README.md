**Long story short** If you just wanna short answer how choose your water cooling build read next :

"D5 pump should be all you need unless you are doing discrete loops. If you are cooling multiple components you don't need multiple loops. Just run it in series and you'll be fine and save some money and headaches. I'd recommend staying away from dyes just to be safe. I use Mystic Fog in my rig for the RGB effect but I accept the risk of clogs and higher maintenance involved. That rad (3x12cm) should work fine for 500 watts. Just use this (clear) coolant for the best performance and longevity of the loop."

This was advice on Alphacool forum I got on long question which you can found in info part of this page.

- one big loop
- D5/VPP655/maybe Apex pump
- 2.4/4mm tubing (easy routing around printer)(polyurethane (10m) and maybe silicone/pvc(2m) softer for printhead)
- 3x12cm aluminium radiator for easy top mounting
- brass nickel plated fittings (maybe stainless steel 304)(idealy aluminium fittings but not from Tameson :D) 
- clear coolant premix

I got confused with note in your products "This product should NOT be installed with any aluminum Fluid Gaming parts!" . Does it means I cannot use it in Aluminium containing loop? Could you please explaint to me that note and are your pumps suitable to work in custom all aluminium loop? Thanks. Have a nice day.
